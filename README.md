### üìã **Specific Modules**

#### **Item Master**

-   **Mandatory Fields**:
    -   `internal_item_name`
    -   `Type` (enum: sell/purchase/component)
    -   `UoM` (enum: kgs/nos)
    -   `Avg_weight_needed` (bool)
    -   `Scrap_type` (for `Type = sell`)
-   **System-Generated Fields**:
    -   `Created_by`, `Tenant_id`, `Id`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`
-   **Key Validations**:
    -   Unique `internal_item_name + tenant` combination.
    -   Non-null `scrap_type` for `sell` items.
    -   `Min buffer` required for `sell` and `purchase` items.
    -   `Max buffer` >= `Min buffer`; defaults to 0 if NULL.

#### **Bill of Materials (BOM)**

-   **Mandatory Fields**:
    -   `Item ID`
    -   `Component ID`
    -   `Quantity` (1--100)
-   **System-Generated Fields**:
    -   `Id`, `Created_by`, `Last_updated_by`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`
-   **Validation Constraints**:
    -   `Sell` items require at least one entry as `item_id`.
    -   `Purchase` items require at least one entry as `component_id`.
    -   `Component` items need both `item_id` and `component_id`.
    -   Unique `item_id + component_id` combinations.
